<h2 class="y2m-sh">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The <i>gpg-card</i> is used to administrate smart cards and USB
tokens.  It provides a superset of features from <i>gpg
--card-edit</i> an can be considered a frontend to <i>scdaemon</i>
which is a daemon started by <i>gpg-agent</i> to handle smart
cards.
</p>

<p>
If <i>gpg-card</i> is invoked without commands an interactive
mode is used.
</p>

<p>
If <i>gpg-card</i> is invoked with one or more commands the
same commands as available in the interactive mode are run from the
command line.  These commands need to be delimited with a double-dash.
If a double-dash or a shell specific character is required as part of
a command the entire command needs to be put in quotes.  If one of
those commands returns an error the remaining commands are not anymore
run unless the command was prefixed with a single dash.
</p>

<p>
A list of commands is available by using the command <samp>help</samp> and a
brief description of each command is printed by using <samp>help CMD</samp>.
See the section COMMANDS for a full description.
</p>

<p>
See the NOTES sections for instructions pertaining to specific cards
or card applications.

<h2 class="y2m-sh">COMMANDS</h2>

<p>
<i>gpg-card</i> understands the following commands, which have
options of their own.  The pseudo-option -- can be used to
separate command options from arguments; if this pseudo option is used
on the command line the entire command with options and arguments must
be quoted, so that it is not mixed up with the -- as used on
the command line to separate commands.  Note that a short online help
is available for all commands by prefixing them with ``help''.
Command completion in the interactive mode is also supported.
</p>

<p>
<ul>

<li><span class="y2m-item">AUTHENTICATE <span class="y2m-args">[--setkey] [--raw] [&lt; <u>file</u>]|<u>key</u>]</span></span>
    <span class="y2m-item">AUTH</span>
Authenticate to the card.  Perform a mutual authentication either by
reading the key from <u>file</u> or by taking it from the command line
as <u>key</u>.  Without the option <samp>--raw</samp> the key is expected
to be hex encoded.  To install a new administration key
<samp>--setkey</samp> is used; this requires a prior authentication with
the old key.  This is used with PIV cards.


</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">CAFPR <span class="y2m-args">[--clear] N</span></span>
Change the CA fingerprint number N of an OpenPGP card.  N must be in the
range 1 to 3.  The option <samp>--clear</samp> clears the specified
CA fingerprint N or all of them if N is 0 or not given.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">FACTORY-RESET</span>
Do a complete reset of some OpenPGP and PIV cards.  This command
deletes all data and keys and resets the PINs to their default.  Don't
worry, you need to confirm before the command proceeds.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">FETCH</span>
Retrieve a key using the URL data object of an OpenPGP card or if that
is missing using the stored fingerprint.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">FORCESIG</span>

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">GENERATE <span class="y2m-args">[--force] [--algo=<u>algo</u>{+<u>algo2</u>}] <u>keyref</u></span></span>
Create a new key on a card.  Use <samp>--force</samp> to overwrite an
existing key.  Use "help" for <u>algo</u> to get a list of known
algorithms.  For OpenPGP cards several algos may be given.  Note that
the OpenPGP key generation is done interactively unless
<samp>--algo</samp> or <u>keyref</u> are given.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">KDF-SETUP</span>
Prepare the OpenPGP card KDF feature for this card.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">LANG <span class="y2m-args">[--clear]</span></span>
Change the language info for the card.  This info can be used by
applications for a personalized greeting.  Up to 4 two-digit language
identifiers can be entered as a preference.  The option
<samp>--clear</samp> removes all identifiers.  GnuPG does not use this
info.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">LIST <span class="y2m-args">[--cards] [--apps] [--info] [--no-key-lookup] [<u>n</u>] [<u>app</u>]</span></span>
    <span class="y2m-item">L</span>
This command reads all information from the current card and display
them in a human readable format.  The first section shows generic
information vaialable for all cards.  The next section shows
information pertaining to keys which depend on the actual card and
application.

With <u>n</u> given select and list the n-th card;
with <u>app</u> also given select that application.
To select an <u>app</u> on the current card use "-" for <u>n</u>.
The serial number of the card may be used instead of <u>n</u>.

The option <samp>--cards</samp> lists the serial numbers of available
cards.  The option <samp>--apps</samp> lists all card applications.  The
option <samp>--info</samp> selects a card and prints its serial number.
The option <samp>--no-key-lookup</samp> suppresses the listing of matching
OpenPGP or X.509 keys.


</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">LOGIN <span class="y2m-args">[--clear] [&lt; <u>file</u>]</span></span>
Set the login data object of OpenPGP cards.  If <u>file</u> is given
the data is is read from that file.  This allows one to store binary data
in the login field.  The option <samp>--clear</samp> deletes the login
data object.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">NAME <span class="y2m-args">[--clear]</span></span>
Set the name field of an OpenPGP card.  With option <samp>--clear</samp>
the stored name is cleared off the card.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">PASSWD <span class="y2m-args">[--reset|--nullpin] [<u>pinref</u>]</span></span>
Change or unblock the PINs.  Note that in interactive mode and without
a <u>pinref</u> a menu is presented for certain cards."  In
non-interactive mode and without a <u>pinref</u> a default value i used
for these cards.  The option <samp>--reset</samp> is used with TCOS cards
to reset the PIN using the PUK or vice versa; the option
<u>--nullpin</u> is used for these cards to set the initial PIN.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">PRIVATEDO <span class="y2m-args">[--clear] <u>n</u> [&lt; <u>file</u>]</span></span>
Change the private data object <u>n</u> of an OpenPGP card.  <u>n</u>
must be in the range 1 to 4.  If <u>file</u> is given the data is is
read from that file.  The option <samp>--clear</samp> clears the data.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">QUIT</span>
    <span class="y2m-item">Q</span>
Stop processing and terminate <i>gpg-card</i>.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">READCERT <span class="y2m-args">[--openpgp] <u>certref</u> &gt; <u>file</u></span></span>
Read the certificate for key <u>certref</u> and store it in <u>file</u>.
With option <samp>--openpgp</samp> an OpenPGP keyblock wrapped in a
dedicated CMS content type (OID=1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.2.3.1) is expected
and extracted to <u>file</u>.  Note that for current OpenPGP cards a
certificate may only be available at the <u>certref</u> "OPENPGP.3".

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">RESET</span>
Send a reset to the card daemon.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">SALUTATION <span class="y2m-args">[--clear]</span></span>
    <span class="y2m-item">SALUT</span>
Change the salutation info for the card.  This info can be used by
applications for a personalized greeting.  The option <samp>--clear</samp>
removes this data object.  GnuPG does not use this info.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">UIF <span class="y2m-args"><u>N</u> [on|off|permanent]</span></span>
Change the User Interaction Flag.  That flags tells whether the
confirmation button of a token shall be used.  <u>n</u> must in the
range 1 to 3.  "permanent" is the same as "on" but the flag can't be
changed anymore.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">UNBLOCK</span>
Unblock a PIN using a PUK or Reset Code.  Note that OpenPGP cards
prior to version 2 can't use this; instead the <i>PASSWD</i> can be
used to set a new PIN.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">URL <span class="y2m-args">[--clear]</span></span>
Set the URL data object of an OpenPGP card.  That data object can be
used by by <i>gpg</i>'s <samp>--fetch</samp> command to retrieve the
full public key.  The option <samp>--clear</samp> deletes the content of
that data object.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">VERIFY <span class="y2m-args">[<u>chvid</u>]</span></span>
Verify the PIN identified by <u>chvid</u> or the default PIN.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">WRITECERT <span class="y2m-args"><u>certref</u>  &lt; <u>file</u></span></span>
    <span class="y2m-item">WRITECERT <span class="y2m-args">--openpgp <u>certref</u> [&lt; <u>file</u>|<u>fpr</u>]</span></span>
    <span class="y2m-item">WRITECERT <span class="y2m-args">--clear <u>certref</u></span></span>
Write a certificate to the card under the id <u>certref</u>.  The
option <samp>--clear</samp> removes the certificate from the card.  The
option <samp>--openpgp</samp> expects an OpenPGP keyblock and stores it
encapsulated in a CMS container; the keyblock is taken from <u>file</u>
or directly from the OpenPGP key identified by fingerprint <u>fpr</u>.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">WRITEKEY <span class="y2m-args">[--force] <u>keyref</u> <u>keygrip</u></span></span>
Write a private key object identified by <u>keygrip</u> to the card
under the id <u>keyref</u>.  Option <samp>--force</samp> allows overwriting
an existing key.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">CHECKKEYS <span class="y2m-args">[--ondisk] [--delete-clear-copy] [--delete-protected-copy]</span></span>
Print a list of keys noticed on all inserted cards.  With
<samp>--ondisk</samp> only smartcard keys with a copy on disk are listed.
With <samp>--delete-clear-copy</samp> copies of smartcard keys stored on
disk without any protection will be deleted.  With
<samp>--delete-protected-copy</samp> password protected copies of
smartcard keys stored on disk will be deleted.

This command creates missing shadow keys.  The delete options print
the status of the keys before they are deleted.

The format of the output is:
</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="y2m-item">Serial <span class="y2m-args">number</span></span>
A hex-string with the serial number of the card.
</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">Type</span>
This gives the type of the card's application.  For example "OpenPGP"
or "PIV".
</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">Keygrip</span>
A hex-string identifying a key.
</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">Keyref</span>
The application slot where the key is stored on the card.  For example
"OpenPGP.1"
</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">Status</span>
The status of the key.  The most common value is "shadowed" for a key
where only the public key along with the card's serial number is
stored on the disk.  The value "clear" indicates that a copy of the
card's key is stored unprotected on disk.  The value "protected"
indicated that a copy of the car's key is stored on disk but is
protected by a password.  The value "error" may also be shown if there
was a problem reading information from the card.

<h2 class="y2m-sh">NOTES (OPENPGP)</h2>

<p>The support for OpenPGP cards in <i>gpg-card</i> is not yet
complete.  For missing features, please continue to use <samp>gpg
--card-edit</samp>.
</p>

<p>
</div>
<div class="y2m-section">
<h2 class="y2m-sh">NOTES (PIV)</h2>

<p>
GnuPG has support for PIV cards (``Personal Identity Verification''
as specified by NIST Special Publication 800-73-4).  This section
describes how to initialize (personalize) a fresh Yubikey token
featuring the PIV application (requires Yubikey-5).  We assume that
the credentials have not yet been changed and thus are:
<ul>
<li><span class="y2m-item">Authentication <span class="y2m-args">key</span></span>
This is a 24 byte key described by the hex string 
<samp>010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708</samp>.
</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">PIV <span class="y2m-args">Application PIN</span></span>
This is the string <samp>123456</samp>.
</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">PIN <span class="y2m-args">Unblocking Key</span></span>
This is the string <samp>12345678</samp>.
</li>
</ul>
See the example section on how to change these defaults.  For
production use it is important to use secure values for them.  Note that
the Authentication Key is not queried via the usual Pinentry dialog
but needs to be entered manually or read from a file.  The use of a
dedicated machine to personalize tokens is strongly suggested.
</p>

<p>
To see what is on the card, the command <samp>list</samp> can be given.  We
will use the interactive mode in the following (the string
<em>gpg/card&gt;</em> is the prompt).  An example output for a fresh card
is:
</p>

<p>

<pre>
gpg/card&gt; list
Reader ...........: 1050:0407:X:0
Card type ........: yubikey
Card firmware ....: 5.1.2
Serial number ....: D2760001240102010006090746250000
Application type .: OpenPGP
Version ..........: 2.1
[...]
</pre>
</p>

<p>
It can be seen by the ``Application type'' line that GnuPG selected
the OpenPGP application of the Yubikey.  This is because GnuPG assigns
the highest priority to the OpenPGP application.  To use the PIV
application of the Yubikey several methods can be used:
</p>

<p>
With a Yubikey 5 or later the OpenPGP application on the Yubikey can
be disabled:
</p>

<p>

<pre>
gpg/card&gt; yubikey disable all opgp
gpg/card&gt; yubikey list
Application  USB    NFC
-----------------------
OTP          yes    yes
U2F          yes    yes
OPGP         no     no
PIV          yes    no
OATH         yes    yes
FIDO2        yes    yes
gpg/card&gt; reset
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The <samp>reset</samp> is required so that the GnuPG system rereads the
card.  Note that disabled applications keep all their data and can at
any time be re-enabled (use help yubikey).
</p>

<p>
Another option, which works for all Yubikey versions, is to disable
the support for OpenPGP cards in scdaemon.  This is done by adding the
line
</p>

<p>

<pre>
disable-application openpgp
</pre>
</p>

<p>
to ~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf and by restarting scdaemon, either by
killing the process or by using gpgconf --kill scdaemon.  Finally
the default order in which card applications are tried by scdaemon can
be changed.   For example to prefer PIV over OpenPGP it is sufficient
to add
</p>

<p>

<pre>
application-priority piv
</pre>
</p>

<p>
to ~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf and to restart <i>scdaemon</i>.
This has an effect only on tokens which support both, PIV and OpenPGP,
but does not hamper the use of OpenPGP only tokens.
</p>

<p>
With one of these methods employed the <samp>list</samp> command of
<i>gpg-card</i> shows this:
</p>

<p>

<pre>
gpg/card&gt; list
Reader ...........: 1050:0407:X:0
Card type ........: yubikey
Card firmware ....: 5.1.2
Serial number ....: FF020001008A77C1
Application type .: PIV
Version ..........: 1.0
Displayed s/n ....: yk-9074625

Digital signature : [none]
      keyref .....: PIV.9C
Key management ...: [none]
      keyref .....: PIV.9D
</pre>
</p>

<p>
In case several tokens are plugged into the computer, gpg-card will
show only one.  To show another token the number of the token (0, 1,
2, ...) can be given as an argument to the <samp>list</samp> command.  The
command list --cards prints a list of all inserted tokens.
</p>

<p>
Note that the ``Displayed s/n'' is printed on the token and also
shown in Pinentry prompts asking for the PIN.  The four standard key
slots are always shown, if other key slots are initialized they are
shown as well.  The <em>PIV authentication</em> key (internal reference
<em>PIV.9A</em>) is used to authenticate the card and the card holder.
The use of the associated private key is protected by the Application
PIN which needs to be provided once and the key can the be used until
the card is reset or removed from the reader or USB port.  GnuPG uses
this key with its <em>Secure Shell</em> support.  The <em>Card
authentication</em> key (<em>PIV.9E</em>) is also known as the CAK and used
to support physical access applications.  The private key is not
protected by a PIN and can thus immediately be used.  The <em>Digital
signature</em> key (<em>PIV.9C</em>) is used to digitally sign documents.
The use of the associated private key is protected by the Application
PIN which needs to be provided for each signing operation.  The
<em>Key management</em> key (<em>PIV.9D</em>) is used for encryption.  The
use of the associated private key is protected by the Application PIN
which needs to be provided only once so that decryption operations can
then be done until the card is reset or removed from the reader or USB
port.
</p>

<p>
We now generate three of the four keys.  Note that GnuPG does
currently not use the the <em>Card authentication</em> key; however,
that key is mandatory by the PIV standard and thus we create it too.
Key generation requires that we authenticate to the card.  This can be
done either on the command line (which would reveal the key):
</p>

<p>

<pre>
gpg/card&gt; auth 010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708
</pre>
</p>

<p>
or by reading the key from a file.  That file needs to consist of one
LF terminated line with the hex encoded key (as above):
</p>

<p>

<pre>
gpg/card&gt; auth &lt; myauth.key
</pre>
</p>

<p>
As usual help auth gives help for this command.  An error
message is printed if a non-matching key is used.  The authentication
is valid until a reset of the card or until the card is removed from
the reader or the USB port.  Note that that in non-interactive mode
the &lt; needs to be quoted so that the shell does not interpret
it as a its own redirection symbol.
</p>

<p>

Here are the actual commands to generate the keys:
</p>

<p>

<pre>
gpg/card&gt; generate --algo=nistp384 PIV.9A
PIV card no. yk-9074625 detected
gpg/card&gt; generate --algo=nistp256 PIV.9E
PIV card no. yk-9074625 detected
gpg/card&gt; generate --algo=rsa2048 PIV.9C
PIV card no. yk-9074625 detected
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If a key has already been created for one of the slots an error will
be printed; to create a new key anyway the option --force can be
used.  Note that only the private and public keys have been created
but no certificates are stored in the key slots.  In fact, GnuPG uses
its own non-standard method to store just the public key in place of
the certificate.  Other application will not be able to make use
these keys until <i>gpgsm</i> or another tool has been used to
create and store the respective certificates.   Let us see what the
list command now shows:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The primary information for each key is the <em>keygrip</em>, a 40 byte
hex-string identifying the key.  This keygrip is a unique identifier
for the specific parameters of a key.  It is used by
<i>gpg-agent</i> and other parts of GnuPG to associate a private
key to its protocol specific certificate format (X.509, OpenPGP, or
SecureShell).  Below the keygrip the key reference along with the key
usage capabilities are show.  Finally the algorithm is printed in the
format used by <i></i> {gpg}.  At that point no other information is
shown because for these new keys gpg won't be able to find matching
certificates.
</p>

<p>
Although we could have created the <em>Key management</em> key also with
the generate command, we will create that key off-card so that a
backup exists.  To accomplish this a key needs to be created with
either <i>gpg</i> or <i>gpgsm</i> or imported in one of these
tools.  In our example we create a self-signed X.509 certificate (exit
the gpg-card tool, first):
</p>

<p>

<pre>

Now creating self-signed certificate.  This may take a while ...
gpgsm: about to sign the certificate for key: &amp;34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB
gpgsm: certificate created
Ready.
$ gpgsm --import encr.crt
gpgsm: certificate imported
gpgsm: total number processed: 1
gpgsm:               imported: 1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Note the last step which imported the created certificate.  If you
you instead created a certificate signing request (CSR) instead of a
self-signed certificate and sent this off to a CA you would do the
same import step with the certificate received from the CA.  Take note
of the keygrip (prefixed with an ampersand) as shown during the
certificate creation or listed it again using gpgsm
--with-keygrip -k otto@example.net.  Now to move the key and
certificate to the card start <i>gpg-card</i> again and enter:
</p>

<p>

<pre>
gpg/card&gt; writekey PIV.9D 34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB
gpg/card&gt; writecert PIV.9D &lt; encr.crt
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you entered a passphrase to protect the private key, you will be
asked for it via the Pinentry prompt.  On success the key and the
certificate has been written to the card and a <samp>list</samp> command
shows:
</p>

<p>

<pre>
[...]
Key management ...: 34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB
      keyref .....: PIV.9D  (encr)

        user id ..: &lt;otto@example.net&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
In case the same key (identified by the keygrip) has been used for
several certificates you will see several ``used for'' parts.  With
this the encryption key is now fully functional and can be used to
decrypt messages encrypted to this certificate.  <span class="y2m-sc">Take care:</span> the
original key is still stored on-disk and should be moved to a backup
medium.  This can simply be done by copying the file
34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB.key from the directory
~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/ to the backup medium and deleting
the file at its original place.
</p>

<p>
The final example is to create a self-signed certificate for digital
signatures.  Leave <i>gpg-card</i> using <samp>quit</samp> or by pressing
Control-D and use gpgsm:
</p>

<p>

<pre>

Now creating self-signed certificate.  This may take a while ...

<p>
The use of gpgsm --learn is currently necessary so that
gpg-agent knows what keys are available on the card.  The need for
this command will eventually be removed.  The remaining commands are
similar to the creation of an on-disk key.  However, here we select
the Digital signature key.  During the creation process you
will be asked for the Application PIN of the card.  The final step is
to write the certificate to the card using <i>gpg-card</i>:
</p>

<p>

<pre>
gpg/card&gt; writecert PIV.9C &lt; sign.crt
</pre>
</p>

<p>
By running list again we will see the fully initialized card:
</p>

It is now possible to sign and to encrypt with this card using gpgsm
and to use the PIV authentication key with ssh:
</p>

<p>

<pre>
$ ssh-add -l
384 SHA256:0qnJ0Y0ehWxKcx2frLfEljf6GCdlO55OZed5HqGHsaU cardno:yk-9074625 (ECDSA)
</pre>
</p>

<p>
As usual use ssh-add with the uppercase -L to list the public
ssh key.  To use the certificates with Thunderbird or Mozilla, please
consult the Scute manual for details.
</p>

<p>
If you want to use the same PIV keys also for OpenPGP (for example on
a Yubikey to avoid switching between OpenPGP and PIV), this is also
possible:
</p>

<p>

<h2 class="y2m-sh">OPTIONS</h2>

<p>
<i>gpg-card</i> understands these options:
</p>

<p>
<ul>

<li><span class="y2m-item">--with-colons</span>
This option has currently no effect.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">--status-fd <span class="y2m-args"><u>n</u></span></span>
Write special status strings to the file descriptor <u>n</u>.  This
program returns only the status messages SUCCESS or FAILURE which are
helpful when the caller uses a double fork approach and can't easily
get the return code of the process.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">--verbose</span>
Enable extra informational output.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">--quiet</span>
Disable almost all informational output.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">--version</span>
Print version of the program and exit.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">--help</span>
Display a brief help page and exit.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">--no-autostart</span>
Do not start the gpg-agent if it has not yet been started and its
service is required.  This option is mostly useful on machines where
the connection to gpg-agent has been redirected to another machines.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">--no-history</span>
In interactive mode the command line history is usually saved and
restored to and from a file below the GnuPG home directory.  This
option inhibits the use of that file.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">--agent-program <span class="y2m-args"><u>file</u></span></span>
Specify the agent program to be started if none is running.  The
default value is determined by running <i>gpgconf</i> with the
option <samp>--list-dirs</samp>.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">--gpg-program <span class="y2m-args"><u>file</u></span></span>
Specify a non-default gpg binary to be used by certain commands.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">--gpgsm-program <span class="y2m-args"><u>file</u></span></span>
Specify a non-default gpgsm binary to be used by certain commands.

</li>
<li><span class="y2m-item">--chuid <span class="y2m-args"><u>uid</u></span></span>
Change the current user to <u>uid</u> which may either be a number or a
name.  This can be used from the root account to run gpg-card for
another user.  If <u>uid</u> is not the current UID a standard PATH is
set and the envvar GNUPGHOME is unset.  To override the latter the
option <samp>--homedir</samp> can be used.  This option has only an effect
when used on the command line.  This option has currently no effect at
all on Windows.
